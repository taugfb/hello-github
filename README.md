# hello-github
First repository as a test

I'm a guy who have always been fond of technology and now i'm making this my job. 
Working with IT since 2019 after years of experience in other fields such as Marketing, Costumer Service, Retail, and at different places like Australia where I've lived for 2 years, Europe where I've worked as a barwaiter at a Cruise Ship (Costa Mediterranea) and of course Brasil (my homeland).
Now (July 2021) my goal is to work with cybersecurity and to achieve this i've been taking many courses and got certifications like (IBM's Cybersecurity Analyst Professional Certificate, EXIN's ISO 27001 Foundation, EXIN's Privacy and Data Protection Practitioner, Certified DPO Data Protection Officer by EXIN, UC Davis' DevOps Culture and Mindset) and currently learning Python.
